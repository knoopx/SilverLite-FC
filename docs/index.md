# About

This documentation is for my custom SilverLite flight controller firmware which is a derivative of the
amazing [Silverware firmware](http://sirdomsen.diskstation.me/dokuwiki/doku.php). 

SilverLite flight controller firmware is **heavily** based on [SilF4ware](https://www.rcgroups.com/forums/showthread.php?3294959-SilF4ware-an-STM32F4-port-of-SilverWare) (an STM32F4 port of Silverware) as well as features from [NFE Silverware](https://community.micro-motor-warehouse.com/t/notfastenuf-e011-bwhoop-silverware-fork/5501). 

Without the hard work and sharing of Silver13/SilverXXX, Markus Gritsch, Travis Schrock and so many others this
project would never exist. What they created and shared was so awesome that it allowed me to make my own spin
of their combined efforts into something that I could use for my own custom needs.

SilverLite flight controller firmware was developed for *my particular use case*: controlling tiny whoops and micro sized quadcopters
as well as for the sheer fun of experimenting and hacking. I don't intend it to be much more than that. NotFastEnuf has been
developing (the hopefully soon to be released) [QuickSilver firmware](https://community.micro-motor-warehouse.com/t/notfastenuf-e011-bwhoop-silverware-fork/5501/1223) (the next iteration of his [NFE Silverware](https://community.micro-motor-warehouse.com/t/notfastenuf-e011-bwhoop-silverware-fork/5501).); I suspect it will
have some really cool features when it comes out. And of course Markus' [SilF4ware](https://www.rcgroups.com/forums/showthread.php?3294959-SilF4ware-an-STM32F4-port-of-SilverWare) is an amazing Silverware derivative that has
RPM filtering, blackbox logging, enhanced DSHOT implementations, etc. Please check out those other projects.

SilverLite supports a minimal OSD and features a very low latency Bayang protocol implementation.
Some of the other features unique to SilverLite flight controller firmware are the enhanced telemetry and configuration that can be 
performed when using my [SilverLite Firmware for the FlySky FS-i6](https://github.com/sakitume/FS-i6-SilverLite) or
my SilverLite TX firmware for STM32, ESP32, ESP8266 (unreleased).
